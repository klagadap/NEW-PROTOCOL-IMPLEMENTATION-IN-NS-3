# NEW-PROTOCOL-IMPLEMENTATION-IN-NS-3
Created a new protocol in ns-3, mostly concentrating the MAC &amp; PHY layers.
To be more precise, we implemented our own medium access control protocol in physical layer and channel. For example, we used the mobility models for random node positions, and the packets between nodes are thus transmitted as per the respective propagation delays. Also, we added certain states that indicates the behavior of physical layer periodically, which can also display collisions. So that, a real-time network can be closely built and can be further studied.
